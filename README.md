Working with VPC

In the Images, I have created a VPC with amazon web services, took a picture of my highest score of cisco binary game, took a screenshot of steven Marrek SAA course, and the network architecture.
created a private and public subnet from which I jumped into the private subnet via a bastion host through ssh and using a .pem file to get it.
